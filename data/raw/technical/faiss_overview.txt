FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It assumes that the vectors are fixed-size arrays of floating-point numbers.

How FAISS works:
1. Indexing: It builds an index of vectors to speed up the search process.
2. Quantization: It can compress vectors to save memory while maintaining search accuracy.
3. Metric: It typically uses L2 (Euclidean) distance or Inner Product (Dot Product) to measure similarity between the query vector and the stored vectors.
