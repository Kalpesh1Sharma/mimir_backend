Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key features include:
- Interpreted Nature: Code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
- Standard Library: A vast collection of modules for tasks ranging from regular expressions to documentation generation.
- Ecosystem: It is the dominant language in Data Science and AI, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
