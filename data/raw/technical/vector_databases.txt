A vector database is a type of database designed to store, manage, and index massive quantities of high-dimensional vector data.

Unlike traditional relational databases that store strings and numbers in rows and columns, vector databases store "embeddings"—mathematical representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning.

Why they are essential for AI:
- Semantic Search: They allow searching by meaning rather than exact keyword matching.
- Speed: They use specialized indexing algorithms (like HNSW or IVF) to find the "nearest neighbors" to a query vector in milliseconds.
- Scalability: They can handle millions or billions of vectors efficiently.
